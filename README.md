## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify tweets into sentiment categories. We use a dataset of tweets and preprocess the text to make it suitable for training a deep learning model. The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is used for sentiment classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets. Each tweet has a corresponding sentiment label (0 for negative sentiment). The dataset is provided in CSV format with the following columns:
- `target`: Sentiment label (0 for negative).
- `text`: The tweet text.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- spacy
- contractions
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk spacy contractions tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing text
- Removing spaces, punctuation, HTML tags, emojis, and URLs
- Expanding contractions
- Removing stopwords
- Lemmatizing text

The preprocessing functions are defined in the script and applied to the dataset to generate a cleaned version of the tweets.

## Model Training

The LSTM model is built using TensorFlow. The model architecture includes an Embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a Dense layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. 

The model is trained on the preprocessed tweet data with the following parameters:
- `batch_size`: 8
- `max_words`: 25000
- `max_len`: 50
- `embedding_dim`: 50
- `lstm_units`: 32

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test data. The evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-tweets.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sentiment-analysis-tweets
```
3. Run the preprocessing and model training script:
```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss on the test dataset. The results are displayed after training and can be further analyzed.
